Shows mastery of logical reasoning and proof construction.",

Uses appropriate logical structure. Shows good understanding of proof techniques and logical reasoning. Would be acceptable with minor clarifications.",

Core idea is present but execution needs improvement. Shows basic understanding of proof structure but reasoning could be more rigorous.",
