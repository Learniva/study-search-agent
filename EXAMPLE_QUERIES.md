Run these 5 queries to verify core functionality:
1. `What is 2+2?` (Math - Python REPL)
2. `What is machine learning?` (Simple web search)
3. `How to implement bubble sort in Python?` (Code generation)
4. `Create a lesson plan on gravity with 5 flashcards` (Educational content)
5. `Explain quantum entanglement with examples` (Complex with sources)

### 15-Minute Comprehensive Test
Run the Quick Test plus:
6. `Compare Python and JavaScript for web development` (Comparison)
7. `What are the latest AI developments in 2024?` (Current events)
8. `Build a simple web scraper in Python with code` (Tutorial with code)
9. `Explain supervised vs unsupervised learning with 3 examples each` (Multi-part)
10. `Create a neural network tutorial with math, code, and exercises` (Complex multi-step)

### Streaming-Focused Test
Run these to specifically test streaming:
1. `What is AI?` (Simple streaming)
2. `Explain machine learning types with examples` (Medium complexity)
3. `Create comprehensive guide on neural networks with code` (Complex streaming)
4. Watch console for indicators: THINKING, SEARCHING, ANALYZING, SYNTHESIZING, COMPLETE

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Watch the Console**: Streaming indicators and search fallbacks are logged there
2. **Source Citation**: Every web search query should end with References/Sources
3. **Code Generation**: Questions with "how to", "implement", "example" should produce code
4. **Progressive Delivery**: Longer responses should appear gradually, not all at once
5. **Pattern Routing**: Simple queries use pattern-based routing (faster, no LLM call)

## üìù Notes

- **Google Custom Search API**: Currently expired, system auto-falls back to Tavily
- **Streaming**: Works in both CLI and API (Server-Sent Events)
- **Role-Based**: Some features differ between student and professor roles
- **Source Quality**: System prioritizes .edu, .gov, .org, Wikipedia over blogs
