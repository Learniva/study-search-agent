# Code Generation Enhancement

## Issue
When users asked for code examples (e.g., "How do I implement a simple neural network in Python?"), the system would:
1. ✅ Find relevant sources (including code tutorials)
2. ✅ Cite the sources properly
3. ❌ **NOT include the actual code** - only describe the steps

Example response was:
> "Sources describe building a simple neural network in as few as 9 lines of Python code, **but a complete, direct code example is not provided**"

## Root Cause
The synthesis prompts in both `_execute_web_search` and `synthesize_results` didn't explicitly instruct the LLM to **generate code** when the question asks for it.

## The Fix

### 1. Enhanced Web Search Synthesis
**File**: `agents/study/nodes.py` → `_execute_web_search()`

**Added code detection:**
```python
# Check if question asks for code/implementation
asks_for_code = any(keyword in question_lower for keyword in [
    'code', 'implement', 'example', 'how to', 'build', 'create', 
    'program', 'script', 'write', 'develop', 'tutorial', 'step by step'
])
```

**Added dynamic code instructions:**
```python
if asks_for_code:
    code_instructions = """
8. CODE REQUIREMENT: This question asks for code or implementation details:
   - You MUST provide actual working code examples
   - Generate complete, runnable code based on the concepts from search results
   - Use proper code formatting with markdown code blocks (```python, ```javascript, etc.)
   - Include inline comments to explain the code
   - Make the code practical and educational
   - If the search results mention a specific implementation (like "9 lines of Python"), 
     recreate that implementation
   - Provide a brief explanation before and after the code
"""
```

### 2. Enhanced Multi-Step Synthesis
**File**: `agents/study/nodes.py` → `synthesize_results()`

**Added similar code detection and instructions** for complex multi-step queries.

## What This Fixes

Now when users ask for code, the system will:
1. ✅ Detect code-related keywords in the question
2. ✅ Search for relevant tutorials and examples
3. ✅ **Generate actual working code** based on the concepts found
4. ✅ Format code properly with syntax highlighting
5. ✅ Include explanatory comments
6. ✅ Provide context before and after the code
7. ✅ Cite the sources where concepts came from

## Example Expected Output

**Question**: "How do I implement a simple neural network in Python?"

**New Response**:
```
Here's how to implement a simple neural network in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Training data: 4 examples with 3 inputs each
training_inputs = np.array([[0, 0, 1],
                           [1, 1, 1],
                           [1, 0, 1],
                           [0, 1, 1]])

# Training outputs: 1 output per example
training_outputs = np.array([[0, 1, 1, 0]]).T

# Initialize weights randomly with mean 0
np.random.seed(1)
synaptic_weights = 2 * np.random.random((3, 1)) - 1

# Train the neural network
for iteration in range(10000):
    # Forward pass
    output = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(np.dot(training_inputs, synaptic_weights))))
    
    # Calculate error and adjustment
    error = training_outputs - output
    adjustment = error * output * (1 - output)
    
    # Update weights
    synaptic_weights += np.dot(training_inputs.T, adjustment)

print("Optimized weights:", synaptic_weights)
```

This implementation uses the sigmoid activation function and gradient descent 
to learn patterns from training data. The network adjusts its weights over 
10,000 iterations to minimize prediction error.

## Supported Keywords
The system now detects code requests when questions include:
- `code`, `implement`, `example`
- `how to`, `build`, `create`
- `program`, `script`, `write`
- `develop`, `tutorial`, `step by step`

## Files Modified
1. `agents/study/nodes.py`:
   - `_execute_web_search()` - Added code detection and instructions
   - `synthesize_results()` - Added code detection and instructions

**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Date**: October 14, 2025

## Test It
Try asking:
- "How do I implement a simple neural network in Python?"
- "Provide code example for binary search"
- "How to create a REST API in Python?"
- "Write a function to calculate fibonacci"

All should now include **actual working code**! 🎉
