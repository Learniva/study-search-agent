# Source Citation Fix

## Issue
When the Study Agent synthesized multi-step results (e.g., multiple web searches), it was not including source citations/references in the final answer, even though the web search tool properly formatted results with URLs.

## Root Cause
The `synthesize_results` function in `agents/study/nodes.py` was combining intermediate results but didn't explicitly instruct the LLM to preserve and cite sources.

## The Fix

### Before
```python
synthesis_prompt = f"""Synthesize these step-by-step results:

Question: {question}

Results:
{steps_context}

Provide a complete answer."""
```

### After
```python
synthesis_prompt = f"""Synthesize these step-by-step results into a comprehensive answer.

Question: {question}

Results:
{steps_context}

IMPORTANT: 
- Provide a complete, well-structured answer
- Include ALL relevant information from the results
- ALWAYS cite sources by including the URLs at the end under a "References" or "Sources" section
- Preserve any source URLs that were provided in the results

Your synthesized answer:"""
```

## What This Fixes

Now when the Study Agent:
1. Performs multiple web searches
2. Gathers information from various sources
3. Synthesizes the results

The final answer will include a **References** or **Sources** section with:
- ✅ URLs from web search results
- ✅ Proper citations for all sources
- ✅ Attribution for the information provided

## Example Output

**Before:**
```
Here's a lesson plan on Linear Regression...
[No sources listed]
```

**After:**
```
Here's a lesson plan on Linear Regression...

## Test
Run `python test_sources.py` to verify sources are included.

## Files Modified
- `agents/study/nodes.py` - Updated `synthesize_results` function
