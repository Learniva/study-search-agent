# 🔍 Troubleshooting

## Google Classroom Issues

### "Google Classroom integration is not enabled"

```bash
# Solution: Add to .env
ENABLE_GOOGLE_CLASSROOM=true
```

### "Credentials file not found"

**Solution:**
1. Download `credentials.json` from Google Cloud Console
2. Place in project root directory
3. Update `.env`:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_CREDENTIALS_FILE=credentials.json
   ```

### "Token expired" or Authentication Errors

```bash
# Delete token and re-authenticate
rm token.json
python main.py --role professor
# Browser will open for new OAuth flow
```

### "Insufficient permissions"

**Solution:**
1. Check OAuth scopes in Google Cloud Console
2. Ensure all required scopes are added
3. Delete `token.json` and re-authenticate
4. Verify you're teacher in the Google Classroom course

### Rate Limiting

Google Classroom API has usage quotas. If you encounter rate limits:
- Reduce frequency of API calls
- Implement delays between batch operations
- Cache results when possible

## Agent Issues

### Low Grading Confidence

**Solutions:**
- Use specific rubrics instead of general grading
- Provide more context about the assignment
- Include assignment instructions
- Break complex submissions into parts

### Inconsistent Grading

**Solutions:**
- Use predefined rubrics (consistency: 94%)
- Enable ML adaptation (learns from feedback)
- Provide correction examples for the system to learn

### Tool Not Found

```python
# Check available tools
from agents.grading import GradingAgent
agent = GradingAgent()
print([tool.name for tool in agent.tools])
```

### Import Errors

```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source study_agent/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies if needed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Performance Issues

### Slow Responses

**Solutions:**
- Enable caching (default: 300s TTL)
- Reduce `MAX_AGENT_ITERATIONS` in settings
- Use simpler, more specific queries
- Check your internet connection

### Memory Issues

**Solutions:**
- Reduce `CHUNK_SIZE` for document processing
- Process large files in batches
- Clear cache periodically

# ✅ Grade posted to Google Classroom
```

## Example 2: Using File Grading Helper

```bash
# List available test files
python grade_file.py --list

# Output shows:
# Python Files:
#   - intro_programming_assignment.py
#   - cs_algorithm_sorting.py
# Text Files:
#   - essay_good.txt
#   - essay_needs_work.txt

# Grade a file with full tracking
python grade_file.py intro_programming_assignment.py \
  --student "Alice Johnson" \
  --student-id "stu456" \
  --professor-id "prof123"

# Automatic:
# ✅ Detects it's Python code
# ✅ Routes to code review tool
# ✅ Retrieves computer_science_intro rubric
# ✅ Provides detailed analysis
```

## Example 3: Student Research Workflow

```bash
python main.py --role student

# Research a topic
[STUDENT] Your request: Explain the difference between merge sort and quick sort

# Generate practice materials
[STUDENT] Your request: Generate 10 practice MCQs about sorting algorithms

# Create visual learning aid
[STUDENT] Your request: Create an animation showing how merge sort works

# Execute code to verify understanding
[STUDENT] Your request: Calculate the time complexity of bubble sort for n=1000
```

## Example 4: Professor Creating Course Materials

```bash
python main.py --role professor

# Create lesson plan
[PROFESSOR] Your request: Generate a lesson plan for teaching binary search trees (75 minutes, undergraduate CS majors)

# Design assessment
[PROFESSOR] Your request: Design a midterm exam for data structures course with 20 questions covering arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues

# Create study guide
[PROFESSOR] Your request: Generate study materials for final exam review covering all graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal)

# Design curriculum
[PROFESSOR] Your request: Design a 15-week curriculum for Introduction to Algorithms course
```

## Example 5: Batch Grading (Python Script)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Batch grade all submissions for an assignment."""

from agents.grading import GradingAgent
import json

# Initialize
agent = GradingAgent()
course_id = "717842350721"
assignment_id = "812453055498"

# Get all submissions
query = json.dumps({
    "course_id": course_id,
    "assignment_id": assignment_id
})

result = agent.query(f"Fetch submissions: {query}")
submissions = json.loads(result)['submissions']

print(f"Found {len(submissions)} submissions to grade")

# Grade each submission
for i, submission in enumerate(submissions, 1):
    submission_id = submission['id']
    student_id = submission['user_id']
    
    print(f"\n[{i}/{len(submissions)}] Grading submission {submission_id}...")
    
    # Fetch content
    content_query = json.dumps({
        "course_id": course_id,
        "assignment_id": assignment_id,
        "submission_id": submission_id
    })
    
    content = agent.query(f"Fetch content: {content_query}")
    
    # Grade
    grade_result = agent.query(
        f"Grade this code submission:\n\n{content}",
        professor_id="prof123",
        student_id=student_id
    )
    
    print(grade_result)
    
    # Review and post (manual step)
    proceed = input("Post this grade to Classroom? (y/n): ")
    if proceed.lower() == 'y':
        # Extract grade from result
        grade = float(input("Enter grade: "))
        feedback = input("Enter feedback: ")
        
        post_query = json.dumps({
            "course_id": course_id,
            "assignment_id": assignment_id,
            "submission_id": submission_id,
            "grade": grade,
            "feedback": feedback
        })
        
        agent.query(f"Post grade: {post_query}")
        print("✅ Grade posted!")

print("\n✅ Batch grading complete!")
